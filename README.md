Chopping an onion could be challenging due to the vapors emitted by the onion after making cuts.

This game consists of a combination of a virtual game and physical activity (chopping an onion).

### 1.4 Objectives
The objectives for this game include testing different methods of avoiding crying while chopping an onion and learning about them. The methods include using goggles, using a fan, and chewing gum. Reporting the effectiveness of the method affects the game interface which makes the game engaging.

The game also includes a fun second stage that is affected by the method chosen by the user in the first place.

### 1.5 Target Audience

## 2. Gameplay Design

### 2.1 Core Mechanics

#### 2.1.1 Description
The core mechanics of the game include tapping and dragging.

#### 2.1.2 Controls
The player interacts with the game using buttons and gestures. In the first stage of the game, the player uses buttons to report the effectiveness of the chosen method. In the second stage, the player uses a rubber to wipe the screen from tears.

#### 2.1.3 Objectives
**Scoring Points:**  As mentioned before, the goal of the game in the first place is to test how effective each method of avoiding crying while chopping an onion is. In the first stage, the player can increase or decrease the blurriness of the screen based on how effective they find their chosen method. They can score positive or negative points every 10 seconds reporting if they are crying or not. In the second stage, the aim is to reveal the photo behind the tears.

### 2.2 Game Flow

#### 2.2.1 Minigame Onboarding
The game starts with a menu including the instructions to choose a method for avoiding crying and how to play the first stage. They are asked to choose a method and prepare an onion for chopping.

#### 2.2.2 First Stage
In the first stage, the player can see a blurred GIF on the screen and a ten-second timer. Every 10 seconds a question with two buttons appears asking them if they are crying or not. If the player chooses they are not crying the score increases by one point and the screen becomes less blurry. If they report they are crying, the score decreases and the screen becomes more blurry. The player can stop the game at any point they wish.

#### 2.2.3 Result
After stopping the game, the players can see their “tear defense score”. At this point, they can choose to play again or play another fun game. Choosing to play again leads to the first page where they can choose the defense method.

#### 2.2.4 The Second Stage: Tear Wiper
Tear wiper tracks the method of which the player has chosen in the first stage. Whichever method they had chosen, they can see a rubber shaped like that method. The player is required to use that rubber to wipe the screen. For instance, if they had chosen chewing gum as a defense method against the vapors, they are presented with a rubber shaped like chewing gum. Wiping the tears reveals a photo of a chopped onion. 
This stage includes a fun twist. If the chosen method is goggles, the rubber is shaped like a minion wearing a goggle. 

### 2.3 Game Modes
**Onion Vapor** is a single-player game that includes two different stages. The first stage affects the interface and method of the second stage.

### 2.4 Challenges
The challenges include testing different methods for avoiding crying and reporting the result based on which they can clear a blurred screen and reveal a GIF (in the first stage) and a photo (in the second stage).
